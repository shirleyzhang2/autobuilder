# autobuilder

Autobuilder is a python script that interfaces with SAP2000, a civil engineering software, 
to construct and analyze high-rise buildings using parameters defined in an Excel spreadsheet.
The program is flexible and can be applied to buildings with various shapes, heights and bracing types.
A data plot will be generated based on building footprint, acceleration and drift to rank the towers
in terms of their seismic performance.

This project will be used by the University of Toronto Seismic Design Team.
