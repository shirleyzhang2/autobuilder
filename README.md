# autobuilder

Autobuilder 1.0 is a python script that interfaces with SAP2000, a structural analysis software, 
to construct and analyze high-rise buildings using parameters defined in an Excel spreadsheet.
The program is flexible and can be applied to buildings with various shapes, heights and bracing types.
A data plot will be generated based on building footprint, acceleration and roof drift to rank the towers
in terms of their seismic performance.

This project was developed in 2019 by the University of Toronto Seismic Design Team.

For the most up-to-date version, see Autobuilder 3.0 which offers more flexibility in design and a functional user interface.
